The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: \"Ace\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film\\'s first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Universal (1995)\\nCast: Robert De Niro, Alan King, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Sharon Stone\\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\\nProducers: Barbara De Fina, Joseph P.

The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Universal (1995)\\nCast: Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer, Christopher Meloni\\nDirector: Terry Gilliam\\nProducers: Robert Cavallo, Mark Egerton, Robert Kosberg, Gary Levinsohn, Lloyd Phillips, Charles Roven, Kelley Smith-Wait\\nScreenwriters: Chris Marker, David Webb Peoples, Janet Peoples\\n\\nWHO ARE WE?\\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

       "  'description': \"When we're young our dreams lie out in front of us, there for the taking, and our plans seem so clear. But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher. \\r\\n\\r\\nA musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland's true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path. \\r\\n\\r\\nRedefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don't always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenres: Drama and Musical/Performing Arts \\r\\n \\r\\nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 25 min. \\r\\n \\r\\nMPAA Rating: PG \\r\\n \\r\\nDistributors: Buena Vista Pictures Distribution \\r\\n \\r\\nProduction Co.: Hollywood Pictures, Radar Pictures, Charlie Mopic Company \\r\\n \\r\\nU.S. Box Office: $82,564,043 \\r\\n \\r\\nFilming Locations: Portland, Oregon, USA \\r\\n \\r\\nProduced in: United States\\r\\n\\r\\nStarring: Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas, Olympia Dukakis, William H.

       "   'I think this film is beautifully made.   Alot of credit goes to Clint for this picture.  The sensuality is on point.   However i don&#39;t want to take away from a man if talent, i think Eastwood is both well cast, and miscast.    He captures the charisma of loner  photographer, but he is such a lousy kisser . Those lips get a little stiff on Meryl.  Im probably going to be criticized for this.  I hate the adult/kids scenes! Everytime it cut away from the narration., got me shouting at the screen get those people out! The love song really annoys me in the kitchen.

       "   'Watching this trailer in the year 2021,  I&#39;m struck by how much the movie industry has changed in 25 years.  Here is a movie that is about an affair of the heart. It is slow, quiet, deeply felt, and portrayed by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep with such skill that you don&#39;t feel like you are watching a movie. You are just a bystander to something special, something glorious, and something very sad. There are no flashy editing, camera tricks or surprises in the plot. You just feel the same dilemma that they feel, and you cry inside at the choice that they are forced to make.  Flash forward to today, and it seems that every movie involves someone flying, things exploding, hordes of stuntmen, and dizzying camera tricks.  Don&#39;t get me wrong. I enjoyed the heck out of Avengers Endgame too. But when you see an old movie like this, you realize that we&#39;ve gained a lot, but also lost a lot, in the art of movie making.',\n",

       "   'I experienced a love encounter similar to this one. But it wasn’t family or obligations that kept us apart... it was a huge age gap... so large, until no one, would have understood it or blessed it. It was magical, supernatural and all consuming and then a veil came down between us, like a impenetrable force of nature, that we just couldn’t move or go around, no matter how strong was the desire....We still felt each other’s presence, as if, we were connected in some invisible, tangible way, but the veil wouldn’t lift. Things and people came in and out, to help ease the heartache, but the longing stayed put, sometimes a blessing, sometimes a curse. Needless to say, I fell in love, with the right person, just not at the right time. But I have Bridges of Madison County to remind me, that I’m not alone. 💖💖',\n",

Loving the truth is as the same as loving Jesus Christ. And he loves you too if you love him or the truth, the same thing. This will make more sense to you eventually through your spiritual training. I suggest deep Bible reading and memorization. I also suggest some meditation between the lines of the Bible, but only if you instinctively feel the urge to meditate as you read. If you don&#39;t then don&#39;t force it because you will be wasting time. The only good way to meditate is if the holy spirit guides you to sit still and do nothing, and then it feeds you. Spiritual thirst, as they call it. I actually do feel a thirst. The Bible is the best for this thirst but you can get it in smaller amounts through good music and good movies and good animes (like Clannad or Steins Gate). The closer you get to God the more you love Travis. I feel something about him I did not earlier.',\n",

       "  'comments': ['Finished watching this yesterday on 2/24/2022 but originally watched it on January of 2021 where the film as well as original story takes place in and all I have to say is what an underrated film this was. Such an interesting film as well mainly because its based in 2021, and that they were predicting what 2021 was going to be like; thankfully 2021 was not like that but I do have to say its somewhat similar and they did predict one thing; a pandemic alongside sickness taking place which they were right as we have this awful pandemic taking place which has now been 2 years since it first started. Not sure why this movie gets so much hate but out of all honesty I do see some reasons. Overall, it was a very interesting movie, yes its kind of all over the place, interesting and difficult to explain but it did have a great storyline, characters, cast such as Ice-T as well as young Keanu Reeves alongside soundtrack. A bit creepy, and confusing in some scenes but other than that it was amazing. Plus the fact that its based in 2021, really goes to show how far ahead they were thinking/predicting which even though much that they predicted hasn&#39;t come fully true yet, it slowly is, especially with the chips and of course the metaverse being a thing now. Not only that, but the fact that its origins came from a book that was written long ago where things weren&#39;t as futuristic as it is now, really goes to show how futuristic the author was even if it cut short in the end which to me was fine as most stories end like that otherwise you&#39;d have to continue on or perhaps have another film for but other than that it truly was truly an amazing film and a film that was very interesting to watch. Glad to have watched it especially in 2021, and in 2022.',\n",
       "   'Such an underrated film, and an interesting one. I originally watched this in the January of 2021 again, as the film, and the original story takes place at that time. Real amazing, how they thought about how 2021 would be, and I guess they got something right, and I would say it would be the &quot;Pandemic/Sickness&quot;. But in all honesty, a very interesting film, with a great cast especially with Ice T, and a young Keanu. Overall, great storyline, characters, and soundtrack added to it. It&#39;s worth watching, but you&#39;d find how &quot;interesting&quot; this movie really is, literally.

       "  'comments': ['You take the amazing cyberpunk production design of this movie and have it as the backing for the 2012 film, and you&#39;d have the perfect 2000AD/Judge Dredd film, instead between the two films I personally feel you have two incomplete parts to a whole. The 1995 movie has the production values and set-design to *perfection*, visually it literally feels like the comic pages came to life on screen, yet you&#39;re also simply experiencing a watered down version of Demolition Man via an egotistical PG-13 Stallone vehicle, not a true Judge Dredd adaption. The 2012 movie captures the character of Dredd perfectly, yet it feels like a contemporary South African police siege drama and lacks all that magical cyberpunk sci-fi imagery and world building of the comics that made them so special. Except for the judges, the costume design of 2012 is non-existent, the landscape bland and barely futuristic, had it at the very least just been set at night with more neon would have helped create some semblance of futurism and comic-accuracy, but instead it feels like a modern day crime story in Capetown with rather ridiculously dressed police officers instead of actually creating a believable futuristic universe. Here&#39;s hoping one day we&#39;re blessed with a perfect adaption. However my above critique isn&#39;t negative, it&#39;s actually a praise to the strengths of both films; 1995 got Mega City One right and Judge Dredd wrong. 2012 got Judge Dredd right and Mega City One wrong. Blend the two and you&#39;ve got perfection. The 1995 movie gets too much hate, yes it was too much of a silly 90s Stallone project, but Danny Cannon NAILED Mega City One, it&#39;s honestly magnificent to this day and just wish the movie could have been what he intended it to be.',\n",

The movie still feels fresh: the technology they use is not too dissimilar from stuff we produce these days. The themes of sexism, race relations etc are as relevant as when the movie came out. One might say the movie sort of predicted the Black lives matter movement. The paranoia and cover ups and the moral dilemmas the characters face, as well as ponderings about the power of media and the media&#39;s ability to define the narrative still resonate.<br>The characters are interesting and well set up. The plot and writing is clever and economical.<br>The performances of all the cast is spectacular.<br>And on top of that it has a kickass soundtrack (I really love the 90s alternative music scene).<br><br>These kinds of movies simply aren&#39;t produced that much today.

I feel very sad to see that in reality only Paul felt something, and unfortunately it was only carnal and not soulful ... And I feel a slight disappointment to learn that Arthur was just a young man with many picturesque but not different ideas about to feelings. <br><br>Indeed, after watching the movie, I spent days trying to analyze the facts, and for me, Arthur and Paul were just two greedy looking for a personal interest. It was not love, it seemed to me more like a relationship of hatred and disturbance of different ideas. <br><br>Anyway, congratulations to the actors and actresses who participated in this biographical work.

Não era amor, me parecia mais uma relação de ódio e conturbação de ideias distintas.<br><br>Enfim, parabéns aos atores e atrizes que participaram dessa obra biográfica.

Les scènes d’action sont nombreuses, fusillades, explosions, combats à mains nues, du désormais classique pour Steven Seagal. Le rythme est soutenu et la distribution offre de bonnes prestations, même si aujourd’hui certaines attitudes apparaissent comme des clichés du genre, notamment l’aspect machiste qui régnait dans les années 1990. Un film qui reste agréable à regarder et qui trouve finalement son originalité de par son action dans un train. <br>Lire ma critique complète concernant ce film : <a href=\"http://wp.me/p5woqV-4aF\">http://wp.me/p5woqV-4aF</a>',\n",

After teaching in a public school for twenty years, Crocker-Harris is being put out to pasture in a less stressful job teaching English to foreigners. Meanwhile, his home life is also falling apart: his wife (Greta Scacchi) is having an affair with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who nevertheless admires Crocker-Harris for his dignity and decency. Through it all, Crocker-Harris hides his pain behind his stiff British reserve.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Paramount (1994)\\nCast: Albert Finney, Ben Silverstone\\nDirector: Mike Figgis\\nProducers: Mimi Polk Gitlin, Ridley Scott, Olivia Stewart, Garth Thomas\\nScreenwriters: Terence Rattigan, Ronald Harwood\\n\\nWHO ARE WE?\\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

       "   'I saw this film in Russian so I&#39;m mystified by this American trailer. If one sees the original, it is not surprising that it had a big impact in Russia in it&#39;s perceived\\xa0telling of the truth of the Russian revolution and its aftermath: that the &quot;White Russian (monarchist)&quot; element (including international links) was always there (hence, later, Stalin), and the &#39;reds&#39; (known to the world\\xa0mass-media as Marxist Soviets) were actually republicans that never truly won. What happens to the old &#39;red&#39; hero at the end of the film\\xa0reflects &quot;that&quot; as much as what the purges of the 1930s were really about. On a totally different level, Eric Rohmer&#39;s Triple Agent tells a 1930s story about the old red-white conflict that is far less melodramatic but is perhaps more realistic by not focusing &quot;too much&quot; on the question of personal suffering as part of the political scapegoat process.',\n",
       "   'What a crock of shit when it comes to producing a trailer. &#39;Burnt By The Sun&#39; isn&#39;t some kind of romantic pastoral film that eulogises the life and loves of a Russian soldier. It&#39;s a Chekhovian domestic tragedy with at its heart the murderous political darkness of the Stalin era purges. Obviously whoever at Sony who decided to give this film a release into the American market either thought the prospective audience were idiots who couldn&#39;t cope with complex themes, or needed to be blatantly lied to.',\n",

This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general. Clerks, filmed in black-and-white on a budget of only $27,000, began the career of writer director Kevin Smith, who would go on to make Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Miramax Films (1994)\\nCast: Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Lisa Spoonhauer, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier, Walter Flanagan, Kimberly Loughran, John Henry Westhead\\nDirector: Kevin Smith\\nProducers: Scott Mosier, Kevin Smith\\nScreenwriter: Kevin Smith\\n\\nWHO ARE WE?\\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

It was only 2 euros and so I decided to buy it, and also because the cover had a dog on it and I was missing my dog, which I have left back to my homeland with my parents.

Yes i made the mistake of watching them in story order rather than release I never used to be interested in star wars as a kid untill I watched from episode 1. But it seems as soon as I get to return of the jedi it just seems very boring and dull. Surely Anakin vs Obi wan and the clone wars scenes are so much more entertaining visually than the duels and trooper scenes  in these films. Effects and story just seem boring after watching 1,2 3.<br>I honestly feel these are only best because they&#39;re classics rather than them being better movies.

I had never seen a movie twice in a theater. My mom and dad knew I’d seen it in July, and seeing a picture twice was a little unusual then, but I really wanted my dad to see it since he grew up liking Flash Gordon. It was a snowy afternoon, we got over to the theater, and I had just as fun the first time. My dad was very impressed and was surprised how much he liked it. We went to “Louie’s” for a late lunch. It was the last time I saw a movie with my dad, I was growing up and wanted to go with friends and dates rather than my pop. I lost him a few years ago, a few months after that, I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. Seeing this clip reminded me I never really had a chance to grieve my dad.

Jo March and Anne Shirley were my childhood heroines, women who valued the inner more than the outer and knew how to take on the world without angrily battling it, and losing the qualities that made them so special. This story is actually a very feminist story, the author Louisa May Alcott was an early feminist. She wrote a tale of women pursuing ambitions, and choosing the men they wanted to build lives with. The &#39;94 version struck a perfect balance of period authenticity to women&#39;s conduct and the spirit of these women; their characters were written and performed in the spirit of the original feminists/suffragettes--with warmth and gentle yet unyielding strength. This version was a masterpiece and the BEST interpretation of the story Louisa May Alcott so wonderfully expressed.',\n",

       "   'To those who liked this take on the famous Mary Shelley novel then good for you but i felt this movie with its cast had such great potential to become a cult classic but before i even heard about Frank Darabont&#39;s opinion about how Kenneth Branagh completely went the wrong way with his screenplay i knew something was wrong after my first viewing of this movie!..<br><br>As i too felt it didnt do justice to the original novel &amp; though Mary Shelley was ahead of her time for writing novel&#39;s but a woman writing a horror novel was at the time unheard of &amp; if you know about her life then you&#39;ll know what tragedy drove &amp; caused her to write such an amazing but disturbing novel which was at the time such a terrifying concept &amp; because of her loss it pushed her to write about something that was so unthinkable to do back then as it would be to do today...<br><br>Mary Shelley was no shrinking violet &amp; who could stand her own ground &amp; not was afraid to speak her mind in a society that was still predominantly ruled by men &amp; women were to be seen &amp; not heard...<br><br>Even if you enjoyed or hated this film &amp; you truly want to know the whole story done the correct way then go straight to the origin source &amp; read her novel...<br><br>This is what Frank Darabont thought about Branagh&#39;s version of the movie which was not how he had written the screenplay as Branagh basically made his own version...<br><br>Frank Darabont<br><br>Original screenwriter\\xa0Frank Darabont\\xa0later called the film &quot;the best script I ever wrote and the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; He elaborated:<br><br>&quot; There&#39;s a weird doppelganger effect when I watch the movie. It&#39;s kind of like the movie I wrote, but not at all like the movie I wrote. It has no patience for subtlety. It has no patience for quiet moments. It has no patience period. It&#39;s big and loud and blunt and rephrased by the director at every possible turn. Cumulatively, the effect was a totally different movie. I don&#39;t know why Branagh needed to make this big, loud film ... the material was subtle. Shelley&#39;s book was way out there in a lot of ways, but it&#39;s also very subtle. I don&#39;t know why it had to be this operatic attempt at filmmaking. Shelley&#39;s book is not operatic, it whispers at you a lot. The movie was a bad one. That was my Waterloo. That&#39;s where I really got my ass kicked most as a screenwriter ... [Branagh] really took the brunt of the blame for that film, which was appropriate. That movie was his vision entirely. If you love that movie you can throw all your roses at Ken Branagh&#39;s feet. If you hated it, throw your spears there too, because that was his movie. &quot;<br><br>I too thought this take on such a classic horror novel fell short of the mark...<br>I can only assume that many liked this version of the old B&amp;W movie classics was because it wasnt like the old B&amp;W movies &amp; moved away from just a madly obsessed scientist &amp; his faithful sidekick Igor robbing the dead of their body parts but instead chose to show part of what Mary Shelley wrote but did it in an overly loud manner...<br><br>This is why the old B&amp;W movies were roundly enjoyed because of its slower pace &amp; how it attempted to take the very basic premise of Shelley&#39;s book &amp; just go with that rather than put the whole book up on the screen &amp; not to do anything more unless it was going to be done ecactly as it was in her novel but B&amp;W horror films were never going to put up on screen what she wrote as it was too disturbing &amp; horrific for those times &amp; are still today but modern readers &amp; movie goers are more desensitized to the violence in this novel but not on its originsl release &amp; hence why it was a huge hit...<br><br>This is why there are not many movies made exactly like Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein novel because if you dont do more than the B&amp;W versions then its walking on old ground but at least this version tried to do  justice to her novel but i can&#39;t express enough that you should read the novel &amp; you&#39;ll know why this novel was such an accomplished piece of sheer horror that has yet to be given its worthy film adaptation as this movie could&#39;ve been the best version to date..<br><br>Sure there have been hundreds of movies about Dracula &amp; films based on vampires separate from the Dracula story which have been made all over the world since that story was written for the silver screen &amp; not far behind it is the original &quot; Wolfman &quot; &amp; again like the vampire movies they moved away from the original origin source &amp; made their own versions of these werewolf movies &amp; lets not forget about the old B&amp;W takes on The Mummy also &amp; both Frankenstein &amp; The Mummy along with the Wolfman never really got the proper versions from the original source material until the 2010 remake of the &quot; The Wolfman &quot; as to me that truly did do justice to the original movie &amp; why it didnt get more praise &amp; should&#39;ve been a bigger hit than it was i think was down to people being tired of werewolf movies &amp; there&#39;s a difference between all those werewolf movies &amp; the original &quot; The Wolfman &quot; film as it was a remake of the original &amp; to me its one of the best remakes from the original B&amp;W version that I&#39;ve seen...<br><br>Time will tell if someone tries to have another go at making a big budget movie version of Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein because this version which Branagh ignored the original screenplay was so badly met with such poor reviews &amp; critism because Kenneth Branagh chose to ignore the original screenplay &amp; in doing so he delivered his version that was savaged in its reviews by film critics &amp; fans of the original novel also &amp; if Branagh had made the movie version of Frank Darabont&#39;s screenplay it would&#39;ve been a cult classic to be enjoyed by generation after generstion but instead what was delivered was a movie sort of like the Frank Darabont&#39;s screenplay but just too loud &amp; missing the finesse it should&#39;ve got in the first place...<br><br>I&#39;d also like tk see a big budget movie about the real Dracula aka Vlad The Impaler as his story was &amp; is more terrifying that the supernatural versions of this true figure who committed such horrors in his attempt to drive back invading forces &amp; save his country which were more horrorific that the movies we&#39;ve grown up watching about Dracula...<br><br>Yet his real life was stranger than fiction &amp; more horrific than the endless Dracula movies that were either loosely based on his story or just some a studio or directors attempt at making a vampire movie rather than a historical movie about this mans real &amp; true life &amp; what he did...<br><br>In light of this still ongoing coronavirus outbreak stay safe and healthy wherever you are in this world...<br><br><br>....',\n",

       "   'Frankenstein 1994 produced by Francis Ford Coppola turned twenty five this year, I watched it again recently. First off I must say it&#39;s a film that doesn&#39;t leave you with a good feeling, most of the characters I either like or don&#39;t mind get killed off in pretty gruesome ways making me wonder what they did to deserve it. It doesn&#39;t pull any punches with its tragic story of one man with a singular obsession to cheat death. Kenneth Branagh directs and stars in the title role with his usual Shakespearean flair, he doesn&#39;t completely stay faithful to Mary Shelley&#39;s original book, but he gets the tragic and twisted figure of Frankenstein across regardless. There&#39;s also a good turn from Robert De Niro as the Monster, Helena Bonham Carter isn&#39;t playing a gothed up doll like princess for once and she&#39;s really good as Elizabeth. This is not a film or story for the faint of heart, it starts off pretty much straight away with one of the leads dying in child birth, and ends on a bleak note where you consider who the monster truly was. An excellent gothic horror adaptation of an old story, which I like and don&#39;t like at the same time because of its cold tone and depressing outcome. However perhaps that is the point, because life is not always sunshine and rainbows.',\n",

Stars John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman\\n\\nFILM DESCRIPTION:\\nOutrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Miramax Films (1994)\\nCast: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeiros, Rosanna Arquette, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Kathy Griffin, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel\\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\\nProducers: Lawrence Bender, Danny DeVito, Richard N.

I don&#39;t agree with all of it, but I do think that the Seal of sanctity of the Confessional is man made and allows evil to fester in the Church. And I think the Church needs to be more forgiving when gay priests break celibacy. Few priest have never fallen once, we are sexual beings it&#39;s hard. When it is a straight priest there is always forgiveness but not for gay priests (of course the sexual abuse of children is completely different, and those priests must be prosecuted and incriminated).',\n",

James Woods is 11 years older than Ms. Stone, thus if her character was 7 at the time of her parent&#39;s murder, he would be around 18, young I agree but  being the crime lords son, and having two henchmen, easily done.  While Rod Steiger who plays his father was just 22 when Mr. Woods was born, that is plausible.  And Eric Roberts, born 1956, would be 28 at the scene when they were in Columbia at the film&#39;s beginning.  Okay, young but a special ops person could be that age.  So it would work out, but having Eric Roberts being the killer of Sharon Stone&#39;s parents when she was around 7 and he being 2 years older, how can that be?',\n",

He decides to murder Clay and take his identity, only Clay survives the assassination attempt with no memory and is mistaken for Vincent. The fact that Harris is white and Haysbert is black only complicates a film that probes into the nature of identity.\\n\\nAfter viewing an early rough cut, Steven Soderbergh came on board as executive producer and enthusiastic patron. Suture went on to become a hit on the festival circuit, including Sundance where it deservedly won the award for Best Cinematography.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ArrowFilmsVideo\\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ArrowVideo \\nFollows us on Instagram: https://instagram.com/arrowvideo',\n",

It’s a shame it has a rotten tomato score of 32% , which just shows you that it doesn’t matter what that score is … if GHOSTBUSTERS 2016 gets 73% fresh and GHOSTBUSTERS:Afterlife gets 62% then you know something is seriously wrong. Granted it isn’t the best film in the world but it deserves more than 32% , hell it  has interesting ideas , two phenomenal actors and a future dystopian premise that should have been set in 2099 as opposed to 1999. Which a lot of films of this nature suffered from. The tech in this film is at least 30-50 years out at least if at all possible. But because everyone was obsessed with 2000 being close to the end of the world … most Hollywood executives were like … no… you have to set it in 1999 because of doomsday and the Y2K … so it seems implausible that in just 4 years we would have SID 6.7 or bionic arms that Parker (WASHINTON’scharacter ) had.

Now, today, Universal is sadly a shedded skin of what it once was. It was thanks to that reviled film-maker, Paul W.S. Anderson, and his Death Race remake...he destroyed it.

Harrison Ford, returning to the Ryan role after his first go-round in 1992's Patriot Games, is assigned to a delicate anti-drug investigation after a close friend of the President (a Reaganesque Donald Moffat) is murdered by a Colombian drug cartel. When Ryan discovers that the President's wealthy friend was in league with the cartel, the President's devious national security adviser (Harris Yulin) and an ambitious CIA deputy director (Henry Czerny) send a secret paramilitary force into Colombia to wipe out the drug lords. The force is captured and then abandoned by the President's lackeys. It falls to Ryan to enter Colombia and rescue them, aided only by a renegade operative named Clark (Willem Dafoe), with both his life and career on the line.\",\n",

Her personal relationship with Hitler is still in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeisty and charismatic at 91, Riefenstahl revisits the landmarks of her turbulent life -- from her beginnings as a daredevil actress in German \"mountain films\" to her direction of such stunning narratives as The Blue Light (1932) and Tiefland (1940s, released in 1954), to her infamous, brilliant documentaries Triumph of the Will (1935) and Olympia (1938), to her anthropological photographs of the now extinct Nuba tribes in Africa.

The New York Times calls this \"fast, funny, full of action...it\\'s \"Lethal Weapon\" meets \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" The Hollywood Reporter calls it \"a fast-shuffling escapade of antic wit...a delightfully appealing, brainy comedy...a royal flush\" and Variety says it\\'s \"exuberant...a whole new generation is about to discover the charm, wit and fun of Maverick.\" #Trailer #WB',\n",

       "   'This stood with me, along with Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Die Hard 3 as the best action movie ever and still is today. And no, i&#39;m not comparing The Matrix (maybe my all-time favorite movie) to any of them. The MAtrix is more of a Sci-Fi cyberpunk masterpiece than an old school action movie. Sometimes i wish we get a simple action movie like Speed and... oh God, i know it&#39;s wrong but sometimes i wish we get a remake of Speed. But not with major plot changes, NO CGI, just remastering the movie in modern days with modern tech and vehicles and ofc IMAX. <br><br><br>Or ...or ... another movie called Spe3d (good puns with the name since it really will be the 3rd movie and they can shoot it in 3d) which takes place in modern days. Keanu is now a retired cop and since it&#39;s trendy Dennis Hopper had a son who lived with his mom (divorced) and is now in his late 20s - early 30s and seeks revenge using his father&#39;s masterplan against Keanu once more. Ed Skrein would be perfect as the villain and replacing Sandra Bullock i guess we can have Nina Dobrev or \\rPhoebe Tonkin BUUUUUT another plot twist she&#39;s Jack&#39;s and Annie&#39;s daughter and that&#39;s why the bomb is planted on her bus. And well... from here on it&#39;s all a imagination let loose. Yes it&#39;s cheesy but think it&#39;s finally what we need with all the alien-superhuman-mutant-robot movies we get the last 2 decades. No CGI, all practical effects, real stunts, real explosions and relatable characters :)',\n",

Don&#39;t get me wrong as his performance was good too, but the two performers looked mismatched. Maybe because at the time Keaton was known for darker theme roles like Batman, One Good Cop, and the Dream Team. I don&#39;t know...I see someone more like John Ritter, Keanu Reeves, Bill Murray or even Bruce Willis or Kevin Bacon as a better fitting for the male lead role with Geena Davis. If they kept Michael Keaton and teamed him with say Leah Thompson or Sandra Bullock or Meryl Streep maybe even Andie Macdowell or Sigourney Weaver than maybe that would of matched nicely too.',\n",

move or moved on with our life’s only god knows why this had happened he lives inside all of us every human being every people inside their hearts he is watching us from the sky and from heaven maybe god did not want you to make it before or after this had happened &amp; we must burn the past &amp; seize opportunities because opportunities only come once in life and sometimes words are gone with the wind &amp; it’s never too late to start over from scratch or it’s never too late to start over to make the ending of the movie &amp; because all the cast and crew were busy with their projects  but you can still do it in the future the past is the past and we have to let it go and we have to moved on to the present and to the future and don’t worry about the past you can still do it so you can get it done and stop thinking about it the fans would be happy satisfy and please to go see the end of true lies 2 because time is money &amp; gold if you make the end one it would be a great hit I would  propose or proposal to go see it with my family and tell my friends and family and all the people I know to go see it I would try to tell everyone I know to go see that movie because i am a really really huge of true lies like Stanley Kubrick  &amp; I am speaking up for all the true lies fans &amp;I didn’t know he liked it too I guess he was another fan of action/ comedy movies just like me I like action/movies &amp; i guess me &amp; the fans like it more because it’s now an action classic movie i use or used to watch it back in the days a lot because It’s my n1 favorite movie of all the times &amp; trust me won’t disappoint because it&#39;s my favorite I am being serious i am not lying I have it on vhs since it came out 25 years ago and on dvd it&#39;s my favorite movie i like the actors &amp; actresses &amp; the cast &amp; crew that is on this movie I have the first movie &amp; i really really like it and I&#39;m waiting for the Blu Ray version &amp; 4k hd Versions of the movie so yeah I will keep my hopes up for the 2nd part you  guys can still do the end of the movie in memory of the two greatest actors that where in this movie Bill Paxton and Charlton Heston or maybe try to make the project that was kept on hold so you guys can be done with this movie or try to compare both movies &amp; see which one is good &amp; which one is not good &amp; we are not forcing anyone &amp; anybody or telling anyone &amp; anybody to do it this is just a comment from me a real fan of true lies &amp; so I hope you guys can talk to the cast &amp; crew of the movie and try to convinced them and tell them that we want to see the end of the story and hopefully you will try to convinced James Cameron &amp; all the cast to reunite one more time to do more action films or movies like this one &amp; after what had happened with eliza dushku we can try to send positive thoughts &amp; good thoughts &amp; support to her &amp; help her bury the past the past is the past and we have to move or moved on with our life’s and focus on the future and on the present and like I told you guys only god knows why this things had happened and she did not want or wanted to tell anyone or anybody about what had happened to her in the past 25 years you don’t have to give anyone the place or we don’t have to take anyone’s place because she was scared or scared or scary or frightened only god knows how she really felt at that time in the past maybe he did that in porpoise to really get her bully or bullying molestated or molestation but what we can all do is send her good vibes &amp; blessings to her and her family because she is a great human being and a great person to work with &amp; a good &amp; great excellent actresses for hollywood &amp; to make movies &amp; what we can all do is try not to remember the past or bury the past memories &amp; start over &amp; try our best that we can to forget about it and I know it’s not easy for everyone &amp; everybody &amp; also what we can do is try not to repeat the same mistakes repeatedly over and over because if someone does something bad one pays for the others &amp; try to focus in the present &amp; future &amp; stay calm &amp; don’t do more bad stuff to anyone or anybody or don’t get into problems so this world can be a better world &amp; hopefully nothing bad happens  and hopefully we can see the end of this great movie and hopefully we’ll see the end of this movie on the movie theaters Cinemas pretty soon hopefully soon and if you guys make it could benefit their careers either or rather you guys make it or not make its going to benefit them on their careers because I would recommend it to everyone and everybody I know so all the fans can see the end and you guys get this projects done I will keep my hopes up to see the end of this movie on Movie theaters Cinemas pretty soon in the upcoming years',\n",

I think I was 8 and I literally couldn&#39;t sleep for three nights in a row because I kept having nightmares and I thought I could get AIDS too. I was crying like a baby... Looking back, of course, it might have been a little too early, but on the other hand, yes, I&#39;m deeply thankful for this movie making me aware of the discrimination and discriminatory behaviour patterns at such an early stage in my life. I was no longer innocent, it changed me, it changed the way I looked at life forever. Although my dad felt really bad after he realized I was actually too young to watch this film... I&#39;m still thankful he let me, because the film is just as unbearable as these times must have been or still are for AIDS-victims, or, as any other kind of discriminatory act was and will ever be.

       "  'description': \"With Hanks, who is always watchable, and Washington, who has also got a very good track record, this film was destined to be fantastic but not even I, who always has an optimistic view when it comes to movies, was ready for the impact that this film made. Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable. All praise to everyone in the making of this beautiful film.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Roberta Maxwell, Buzz Kilman, Karen Finley, Daniel Chapman, Mark Sorensen Jr., Jeffrey Williamson, Charles Glenn, Ron Vawter, Anna Deavere Smith, Stephanie Roth Haberle, Lisa Talerico, Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot Keywords: Pennsylvania, City Name In Title, Philadelphia, Male Nurse, Gay Lead Character, Bigotry, AIDS, Gay Rights, Disease, Prejudice, Homosexual, Homophobia, Medical, Terminal Illness, Gay Slur, Political, Philadelphia Pennsylvania, Blockbuster, Costume Party, Gay Interest, Hospital, Lawyer, Library, Mother Son Relationship, Trial, Sexuality.\",\n",

       "   'I directed this as my final thesis project in college, and the MOST interesting thing about it, is that race is really NOT the central theme at all, it’s merely circumstantial that Paul happens to be black and the Kittredges white. It’s actually a VERY powerfully written play, with great allegorical references to Catcher in the Rye, chaos theory, and the art of Wassily Kandinsky, BUT, the most arresting thing is the relationship between Ouisa &amp; Paul. Why does she become obsessed with him? What does she see in him that no one else sees?Why does she experience such PROFOUND change in herself and her identity as a privileged white, upwardly mobile New York society woman because of a singular encounter with an African-American hustler? Although race isn’t the central theme, it’s certainly a significant factor in how the relationship between Paul and Ouisa develops. I wrote my entire senior thesis on the exploration of the “hustler” or the “gigolo” in modern cinematic and theatrical culture as an outgrowth of directing this, because I was studying homosexuality in theater and film at the time. Is Paul gay or is he just lonely, what is his past, his real name? Six Degrees is fascinating, mainly because it debunks the myth that a play should answer questions more than it should ask them. My biggest regret is that I was never able to speak to John Guare personally while I was directing Six Degrees, although I know the play is loosely based on the events that happened between a wealthy New York couple that were friends of John Guare’s named the Elliots and a con man named David Hampton (upon whom Paul’s character is based) who spent the night in their apartment, and they awoke to find him in bed with a hustler and called the police. Years later, Guare wrote the play based on that story. What I, as a director REALLY wanted to know was what it was like for Guare to undergo stalking and harassment by this man David Hampton after the critical success of Six Degrees on both Broadway and on film? Apparently, he harassed Guare for YEARS about it, because he felt he was “owed” because a chapter of his life story was based on the play and film. I find it to be a FASCINATING exploration of the darkness that lives in all of us, and why our capacity to victimize each other as human beings is ENDLESS. If you haven’t seen either the play or the film, watch it. It was revived on Broadway back in 2017 with Allison Janney playing Ouisa, and that would have been interesting to see her take on the character, because she’s SO different from Stockard Channing. To me, Stockard Channing IS Ouisa Kittredge, she disappears into the character completely, and you forget you’re watching Stockard Channing. When I cast my Ouisa, I realized I kept calling back ONLY brunette actresses that looked like Stockard Channing —talk about typecasting right? 😆 What’s SO deeply interesting about Ouisa is that someone who seemingly “has it all” is SO FUNDAMENTALLY disgruntled and unfulfilled and dissatisfied with her life, and she longs to be like Paul (free-spirited, clever and dangerous) is the conclusion that I inevitably drew. Anyway, I’m so grateful to have had the experience of directing this piece, because it’s extremely multi-layered, and you have to cast the roles JUST right, or it becomes a total farce and could be viewed as comical, when it’s fact, filled with pathos and some VERY dark themes. Six Degrees is fascinating. It’s also an incredible piece to direct if a director is looking to gain the experience of directing a truly rich ensemble of characters, because each character is SO layered. It takes good casting to really achieve this, and each “family” of actors has to be totally convincing as well, a family or it doesn’t work. It was the hardest and the best experience I’ve ever had as a director because it’s a VERY complicated story. And it’s most definitely a “Naked City” New York kind of a story, and the fact that I’m a native New Yorker gave me SOME insight into the pathos of the characters, but it’s a VERY DIFFICULT piece to direct because as I said before, if you get the casting wrong, it goes COMPLETELY sideways. What’s sooooooo hilarious is that in a way, Six Degrees predicted the future: Paul mentions that his father is directing a film version of the Broadway musical Cats, and Ouisa wrinkles her nose in a snooty way and says she thinks a film version of Cats would be ridiculous. Flan then tells her not to be snooty. Fast forward to 2019: the film version of Cats is well, RIDICULOUS 😆😆😆😆😆😆',\n",

The last thing I would&#39;ve wanted was to be fettered by a legal document to another person. I don&#39;t think Gertrude Stein would have been at all interested in being a legal husband to Alice B Toklas as her wife. I think she would&#39;ve been completely repulsed by the idea. Radclyffe Hall, maybe, might&#39;ve liked the idea of being a husband to one of her female lovers, since that was a thing for her. <br>Anyway, I love the film and I have the book too.

Wiki claims that Sarah conner is on the run with her 10yr old son, but instead we see a 13-14yr old John Conner. When realistically, we are supposed to see a 6-7yr old boy.

       "  'description': \"A sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star Arnold Schwarzenegger A-list Hollywood names, writer/director James Cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor (Edward Furlong), during the late nineties. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about humankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which won four Oscars in technical categories for its groundbreaking effects, was followed by a short sequel filmed exclusively as an attraction for theme parks, Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time (1996). - Karl Williams, Rovi\\r\\n\\r\\nMore on Terminator 2: Judgement Day at:\\r\\nhttp://www.MovieBout.com/index.php?movie=178\\r\\n\\r\\nMovieBout.com - The Movie Discovery Assistant\\r\\nhttp://www.MovieBout.com\",\n",

       "   'I see a lot of people comparing Dances With Wolves to Last Samurai, Avatar or Lawrence of Arabia. Having seen all those movies, and only having just seen this movies. I can say confidently Dances with Wolves is far in comparison from a &quot;White Guilt&quot; or &quot;White Savior&quot; movie.<br><br>First of, I think the Movie did a decent job of proportionately showing the &quot;Savageness of the Natives&quot; with the &quot;Ignorance and Devastation of the Whites&quot;. It also subtlety points out that a lot of hostility between the two people are due to incomprehensible cultural differences. As well intentioned as Dunbar and the Sioux were they couldn&#39;t get along, less because of pure bigotry but simple Xenophobia, ignorance and mostly lack of knowledge and comprehension of cultural concepts.<br><br>When the Sioux man took Dunbar&#39;s hat, he didn&#39;t think he was stealing it he thought that Dunbar didn&#39;t want it anymore, they finally came to a consensus and made a trade. On the other end, the Sioux were deeply upset when they found the buffalo bodies without their fur, as the white Americans left their bodies and only took their tongues and fur, disrespecting the Animal and nature. (at least that&#39;s how I interpreted it), a lot of conflicts were started simply due to cultural misunderstandings.<br><br>Also the white savior trope is no where as prevalent as it was in Last Samurai or Avatar. Just like in Lawrence of Arabia, no matter how much our &quot;Hero&quot; tried to help the Natives, he ended up doing arguably more harm than good.<br><br>I think the main point of the movie is not to guilt white people or glorify the &quot;Wise Open-Minded White Savior&quot; but celebrate the Sioux Culture and portray the journey it takes for someone from a different culture to not merely respect and befriend a people, but be so moved from something so foreign to come to identify himself as one of them.',\n",

The film opens on a particularly dark note, as melancholy Union lieutenant John W. Dunbar attempts to kill himself on a suicide mission, but instead becomes an unintentional hero.\\n\\nHis actions lead to his reassignment to a remote post in remote South Dakota, where he encounters the Sioux. Attracted by the natural simplicity of their lifestyle, he chooses to leave his former life behind to join them, taking on the name Dances with Wolves. Soon, Dances with Wolves has become a welcome member of the tribe and fallen in love with a white woman who has been raised amongst the tribe.\\n\\nHis peaceful existence is threatened, however, when Union soldiers arrive with designs on the Sioux land.\\n\\nThe film has won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\\n\\nCast: Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, Rodney A.

Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is unemployed and aimless, hovering between childhood and adult responsibilities. A year out of college, Tom can't land a decent job -- he still lives with his mother in Brooklyn. He receives a call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who informs Tom that her son Bill, Tom's best friend in high school, has killed himself. She wants Tom to deliver the eulogy and serve as a pallbearer, and flustered, Tom agrees, though he has no recollection of Bill. After delivering a lackluster eulogy, Tom meets the grieving Ruth and begins an impulsive affair with her. He also encounters Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful classmate for whom he's long carried a torch. Although Julie at first mistakes Tom for someone else, they begin dating, while he keeps his relationship with Ruth a secret. First-time writer-director Matt Reeves work-shopped the script for The Pallbearer with writing partner Jason Katims at the Sundance Institute. Reeves went on to create the TV series Felicity.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Miramax Films (1996)\\nCast: David Schwimmer, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Vartan\\nDirector: Matt Reeves\\nProducers: J.J.

       "   'Fear is a 1996 thriller film from a time when plots relied on teenage spirit more than technology. Mark Wahlberg early on skillfully blends the menacing personalities of his character well with his predatory interest in co-star Reese Witherspoon, whom also displays earlier work here. David played by Mark, is cool lowkey dude love one second and over-controlling psycho the other. If you are a fan of his latter work, usually in the role of an all-American kick-a** action hero, this film showcases range. This film is supported with some comedic relief when we are critical of some intense scenes, but this is a result of time occurring rather than terrible acting. Nonetheless, if you enjoy the look of the 90s grain on screen and want a thriller without takeaway morals, this is recommended. It is worth the butter on your popcorn!'],\n",

Angus is funny, rowdy and triumphant, a totally cool movie with a dead-on eye and ear for the hilarious, heartbreaking rite of passage called high school. A great cast (including Academy Award® winners* George C. Scott and Kathy Bates as Anguss oddball family) sparks this story about what happens when Angus is named King of the Winter Ball as a prank and how he turns humiliation into victory. Angus, Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, delivers a rousing up yours to all the snotty high school golden boys [and] a climax that I, for one, found wholly the equal of anything in Rocky.\\n\\nDirected By Patrick Read Johnson\\nStarring Charlie Talbert, George C.

William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named \"Nobody,\" who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody\\'s help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.\\n\\nWelcome to the Fandango MOVIECLIPS Trailer Vault Channel.

In the bathroom scene La Beaumont seems to refer to that outcome as an unintended consequence, not as something she had planned. It seems to me that she initiated her flirtation out of willfullness, but I&#39;m still not sure how she thought it would benefit her.

You&#39;re shocked bcs you put expectations on her without knowing her. Sounds like it was convenient for Ms. Bentley to have that relationship since she was caring for her father. But that&#39;s only a guess. Could be she never found the right one, until now. ... Question 2) My answer: For Miss Bentley. Ms. Beaumont mentioned this in the bathroom scene towards the end.',\n",

       "   '[ O SACRIFÍCIO DE SANGUE NA TERRA ] O sangue derramado não vos reconcilia nem um pouco com DEUS, nem pode suscitar Sua comiseração nem mudar Sua justiça . O sacrifício de sangue não possui sentido e constitui crime da pior espécie. Nem mesmo o sangue de CRISTO pôde melhorar o destino da humanidade. TODO COMENTÁRIO NESTE SENTIDO É CONTRARIO A DEUS. UM ENGANAR-SE A SI PRÓPRIOS OU UMA MENTIRA TRANSMITIDA. Data de milênios o sacrifício de sangue Iniciou -se no mais remoto paganismo. Os Israelitas sacrificaram com sangue a fim de reconciliar os homens com DEUS.  Os Metháris   nossos avós jamais aprovaram semelhante sacrifício. Todas referências desse gênero não passam de falsificações dos padres de então,porque não queriam deixar seus velhos hábitos. Se por acaso um semelhante sacrifício de sangue e de fogo fosse executado na presença de uma nave espacial imediatamente seus executores seriam destruídos com a força dos raios. [  E um  fogo saído da presença do Senhor consumiu sobre o altar o sacrifício de fogo e de gordura. E todo o povo viu e dando gritos de alegria jogou~se por terra, pousando o rosto no chão. ]   ( Moisés, 3,27 )   grande  o engano ao se acreditar que CRISTO tenha cancelado com seu sangue os pecados de toda a humanidade. Um antiquíssimo dogma foi conservado e depois aplicado a CRISTO. Acreditava-se naqueles tempos que o corpo e o sangue de Cristo  tivessem um poder reconciliador muito maior do que o sacrifício de sangue derramado por qualquer animal. Esse dogma do sacrifício é um gravíssimo erro, o qual se conservou até o dia de hoje. CRISTO tinha realmente a incumbência, de ensinar  a verdade da palavra do SENHOR, do ESPÍRITO de DEUS. Ele  usou as santas forças divinas para o bem e provou com isto poderem as leis terrestres ser submetidas  a leis mais altas. Seu sangue não salvou sequer uma alma; somente o poder de SEU AMOR  poderá salvar. Sobre aquilo que afirma a teologia, apoiaram-se os governantes e os poderosos. O sacrifício de sangue foi exigido a todo o homem para a defesa e para a conquista de um ideal ou para punição de um erro. ou de um engano. Primeiro foram sacrificados os animais, hoje são os homens. O sangue de milhões de soldados e cidadãos não deverá reconciliar DEUS mas os Governantes e Poderosos dessa Terra. Aquele que derramou o próprio sangue tornou-se um herói. Nem os governantes,nem os poderosos dessa terra,nem os povos poderão reconciliar-se  entre si porque o derramamento de sangue não passa de um dogma perigosíssimo. Somente o Amor pode reconciliar e nada mais. A luta entre o bem e o mal é essencialmente grande nesse planeta, e nós nunca suspeitamos pudesse tomar uma tão grande extensão,embora não se ignore que muitas crises favoreçam a uma afirmação demoníaca. O destino da terra acha-se situado no centro da atenta preocupação geral. Aquilo que DEUS predispôs deverá ser realizado. Para vós o sangue do homem custa pouco. Possui menos valor que o corpo. Se os homens morrerem, as maquinas continuarão a semear a destruição, eletromagnéticas comandadas. Tornaste-vos mestres em provocar hecatombes, no derramamento de sangue em massa-não porém na conservação e melhoria de vida em massa nem na apreciação do santo sangue. Não só o sangue do CRISTO é SANTO, mas o sangue de todo o homem vivente, sem distinção de raças é igualmente SANTO.  Se não fordes punidos não existirá nada mais fácil do que matar-vos. Todo o estado pode permitir-se,desde que não escuta a voz da consciência, nem nada conhece do UNIVERSO nem de DEUS. Entretanto a maioria dos estados conhece só um DEUS escrito sobre o papel.  Assim como existem várias raças sobre esse planeta,assim existem várias humanidades sobre as muitíssimas  estrelas do Universo. As raças deveriam completar-se e ajudar-se reciprocamente como também as várias humanidades deveriam fazê-lo. Por esta razão nos esforçamos  em fazer-vos superar vosso atraso. Nosso modo de ensinar, para vós  pouco usual,,e a maneira de vós transmitir nossas mensagens foram-nos prescritos, pois tudo deverá obedecer a um preciso escopo . Reconhecemos que a dificuldade na qual se encontra a humanidade terrestre é excepcionalmente grave. Não conhecemos nem um caso semelhante a esse,nem mesmo longinquamente. Sobre essa estrela reinam ,soberanas a violência extrema, a opressão mais forte e a mentira desavergonhada. A situação tornou-se tão perigosa ponto de impossibilitar a todo e qualquer estado de permanecer distante da guerra, visto esta lhe ser imposta por um louco adversário. Porém loucura é sinônimo de impiedade descrença. Quem for atacado deverá defender-se, não existindo outra escolha. A única maneira de se evitar a guerra seria a de executar o desarmamento geral,a poder de uma fé sadia em DEUS e pelo conhecimento da Verdade Universal.',\n",

       "  'description': \"During the American Civil War, a Union Army captain leads his rag-tag cavalry troop up a misty creek to a remote farm to steal enemy (Confederate) livestock. The farm is wroked by Sarah Anders, whose husband is away fighting for the Confederate Army. Far from the great armies and battlefields, a very private civil war erupts. The Captain and Sarah are pulled apart by the war's undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. Each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. This story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. Armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. Good people can be driven to do bad things. The story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. Based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the Civil War.\\n\\nMPAA Rating: PG-13 for brief violence and sexual references.\\n\\nCast: Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson is available on DVD\",\n",

It is soon learned by the military that a number of enormous objects are on a collision course with Earth. At first thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species. After attempts to communicate with the aliens go nowhere, David Levinson, an ex-scientist turned cable technician, discovers that the aliens are going to attack major points around the globe in less than a day. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles, and Washington. The survivors set out in convoys towards Area 51, a strange government testing ground where it is rumored the military has a captured alien spacecraft of their own.

Then, when the world counterattacked, the alien ships are invincible to normal weapon systems, then The President of the United States, decides to head to area 51, to formulate a plan to defeat the aliens. Now, the fate of the world rests on a handful of surviving humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ultimate encounter when mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all out invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear in Earth's skies. But wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet.

       "   'One of the best movies I&#39;ve ever seen. The character development was incredible, from the way Robert Di Niro is joyful and happy about his team even defending Bobby Rayburn from the raido talk host to helping out his son with his little league game despite making his son cry and feel pressured to taking his son a few moments back to the grand opening of the Giants Game with Rayburn playing but then having to leave to attend a meeting because of how society works; you work, work, work and you truly never get to experience how happy life can be or anything that you truly loved as a kid like him being a fanatic with the Giants like my brother and I are in for a sports team but not that fantic like he was. Although I&#39;m not much a fan of baseball, or understand it at all I do like the movie. He was just a guy who wanted to make the big league, the MLB, the San Francisco Giants with his major success as a baseball player in the little league even saving his team and becoming the star player of the little league..  he just never had that chance to make it to the big leagues as he was never signed or scouted at all. You can see that everything he had and wanted slowly fall out of his hands almost as if he lives in a world that doesn&#39;t fit his tune anymore especially with the divorce he had alongside the fact that he lost his son which was a major part in how the remaining of his life will unfold which he saw in Rayburn as he too was going through the same thing. He always wanted to impress his son like Rayburn does to his in order to get approval and when he notices that Rayburn doesn&#39;t get what he wants, like Gil did as a kid he realizes that he can&#39;t let Rayburn go through the same thing he went through. Having all the pontentinal, the fame, but ending up as nothing just a regular. Gil was a guy who could&#39;ve been a HIT! But bad luck hit him as he was never signed or scouted thats why he takes things so serious about the sport, its the fans that gets you there even if they do end up stabbing your back. In addition to that you can see how obsessed he gets with the things he truly loved and wanted to be after the divorce as these were the things that always made him happy and he can&#39;t afford to loose them as thats all he has left hence why he looks at the screen various time seeing his face in front of the stadium. You can tell that his family has always lived under people like his dad who crafted one of the best knives ever but couldn&#39;t sell them because he was a terrible business man ending up with him becoming a hamster for society to take over his idea, using him with a return of nothing. Yes, you feel bad from Rayburn especially the kid but people have to realize that you can&#39;t just disregard the fans, the reason why the club exists, the reason why the sport exists is because of the fans. Not just you, or someone else but instead the fans. You&#39;re actually earning something from them, and they aren&#39;t. You should be appreciating them as they apperciate you. All these things I&#39;ve stated just now is what you could say is the moral of the story. You can  be the best at something but its the fact that you also need luck and hope that someday you&#39;ll be noticed or that you&#39;ll reach success with fame. Kinda in a rant at this point and got off topic but this is how good the movie was. You end up feeling bad for both characters, not just Rayburn. In all honestly, Robert Di Niro was the star here. As for Rayburn all you can see are flaws and how he takes everything for granted but soon realizes that he got to where he is now because of the fans and all they ever want is a simple thank you. That simple. You just have to watch the movie yourself as its so shocking while also a mystery of both joy and sadness. My twin brother even recommended this movie to a friend of ours thats how good it was. Robert Di Niro &amp; Wesley Snipes never fail to amaze me. Although they&#39;re also the reason why I watched the movie in first place after searching up a bunch of my favorite actors and noticed that they themselves did a movie with each other. To bad that age kinda took a toll on them as they&#39;re slowly getting older and older to the point that they don&#39;t make a lot movies anymore with either each other or just themselves. This is a movie that we&#39;ve all been through we always expect to make it to the big league, the big team, but don&#39;t because of how nobody actually cares they&#39;re just in it for the money as well as fame. To the point where we can&#39;t afford to let things that we love go... thus taking drastic measures like he did. I saw a couple comments back about how hurtful a divorce is so I honeslty feel bad for them and hope for the best for them as well as myself. 🙏🙏🙏',\n",
       "   'A great movie, with a great message around it. Personally one of my favourite films. I really enjoy how it shows the somewhat perspective of a &quot;true fan&quot; (not the messed up apart of it especially Gil&#39;s mental issues, true fans don&#39;t do that, those are for maniac super fans). Even though I&#39;m not a giants fan, nor a baseball watcher, I follow this other club, and even sponsor/support it, and I could say I would feel like Gil sometimes when some players, would not care about its fan or the club, just the money part of the sport and the club. You can see this in many other clubs but luckily my club has never had that issue and were one of the most successful, &amp; underrated team in European futebol ⚽, we may not be the biggest, but its what we are that makes us who we are. To me, a true fan of a club is a fan that supports from the start, never backs down, and always wants his club to succeed. A true fan doesn&#39;t care if his team wins or looses, and they are proud of its history. They don&#39;t wear the jerseys or badge to show off, but instead to represent the club,  and show that they are apart of a family. It&#39;s so hard to explain what a true fan is to be honest because its not really something you can explain, but you feel. I&#39;ve supported my club since the start, and I was raised around it. The club has given me so much, and I&#39;m proud of it&#39;&#39;s accomplishments. I can be judged for supporting it, but I&#39;ll never be ashamed of it. I wear the  badge with pride. A true fan, such a hard concept. Now back into the movie as I sidetracked lmao. Great movie, with two great actors, definitely my top ten favourite actors and the movie as well. I don&#39;t understand its bad rating, but I think it gives a great message, about what fans give, and what players should think before playing as I do. &quot;As it says; Without fans you would be fucking nothing, we give you your 40 million&quot; -Gil. No matter what, a true fan always does stuff to support his club, and are not ashamed of it, but remember, to support your club legally. But yeah, a great movie, touching a complex topic of fandoms. To be honest, I would love to write a blog or a book about what being a true fan is to a club, and this will definitely be a touching point for it. Only thing is to exclude the illegal and gruesome stuff, which I totally wish  Gil didn&#39;t have to resort too. 📌 1893 forever.  I hope people don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy for writing this much.  I&#39;m just glad I get to be with such a great club and take part of it.  What a great fucking film though, great sound track, actors, storyline and just overall a really really underrated film.',\n",

The King of Comedy was very well received by critics, De Niro was applauded for his performance, but it was a box office bomb. <br><br>So The Fan made a lot of sense at the time. It allowed De Niro to pick up that kind of performance again by playing a similar character, but this time it had a big budget, Wesley Snipes (who was a big star at the time) and a good cast. That was more or less the background and although it&#39;s nowhere near as good as The King of Comedy, it was still fairly entertaining due to De Niro&#39;s performance.',\n",

Over ten months, we follow the mad Artaud from his cruel coaching of an actress in his \"theatre of cruelty\" to his semi-friendship with Prevel who buys him drugs and hangs on his every word. Meanwhile, Prevel divides his time between Jany, his blond, young, drug-hazed mistress, and Rolande, his dark-haired, long-suffering wife, who has a child during this time. Cruelty, neglect, poverty, egoism, madness, and the pursuit of art mix on the Left Bank.\\n\\nSubtítulos en español',\n",

But not forget: some &#39;real&#39; superpowers obviously are still in possession of the military and in school you learn much crap instead and waste years.<br>Have you ever considered what you could perhaps use a smartphone for in combat if you patched the GPS system routines and removed the &#39;enhancement&#39; of the camera image to detect the enemy better with AI? A walkie-talkie, two different sorts of compasses, a map with automapping function, You could perhaps even calculate tactics and strategies, or use it as a lie detector during interrogation with an app. Your &#39;intellectual&#39; property laws are even sicker than ours. Conclusion: any thought could be a threat to national security, but you could still make business with it.

Most of his friends, however, have graduated to the instant financial gratification of petty drug dealing. Hank yearns to escape his neighborhood and spends his entire savings on lottery tickets hoping to win the $27 Million Dollar Jackpot. His dad, Milt, doesn't set much of an example--working a brain-numbing job at the phone company and soothing the ache of a ruined marriage and a dead-end career as a musician with his constant companion--a bottle of whiskey. Hank seeks his comfort through Joy, his Latina girlfriend, who has her eyes set on the future. As their romance grows--another begins. Hank's father and Florence, Joy's adoptive mother, struggle to deal with their rapidly changing children. In doing so, they find themselves seeing each other in new ways. Their relationship is warm, cautious, and based on the surprise of mutual respect.               Produced by  Carlos Hernandez (III), John Rubino, Michael J.

Grant plays Peter Joshua, who meets Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) in Paris and later offers to help her when she discovers that her husband has been murdered. After the funeral, Reggie is summoned to the embassy and warned by agent/friend Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) that her late husband helped steal 250,000 dollars during the war and that the rest of the gang is after the money as well. When three of the men who attended her husband's funeral begin to harass her, Reggie goes to Joshua for help, at which time Joshua confesses that his name is actually Alexander Dyle, the brother of a fourth accomplice in the gold theft. The three men from the funeral are revealed to be the three other accomplices in the crime, and though she knows next to nothing of the heist, Reggie is caught in a ring of suspense as she is followed by the shadowy trio, all after the money. Apparently, the only person she can trust is Joshua/Dyle -- until Bartholomew tells Reggie that the fourth accomplice had no brother, and Joshua/Dyle reveals that he is, in fact, a crook named Adam Canfield. Now Reggie doesn't know where to turn. The musical score by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini was nominated for an Academy Award.\\n\\nCREDITS:\\nTM & © Universal (1963)\\nCast: James Coburn, Cary Grant, George Kennedy, Walter Matthau, Audrey Hepburn\\nDirector: Stanley Donen\\nProducers: Stanley Donen, James H.

But I don&#39;t think movie scenes should be cut from the film or the film be banned from film libraries.  Margaret Mitchell made sure the reader knew throughout the entire book that the South was the big loser &amp; was thus punished severely, that Scarlett never won &amp; didn&#39;t live happily ever after.  It was a cautionary tale of what happens when you are on the wrong side of what&#39;s right.  I like to think the book &amp; film opened eyes &amp; was a baby step leading the way to Roots &amp; 12 Years a Slave.  The movie/book held a mirror up to their past in a way that Southerners could handle at that time (&quot;a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down&quot; approach), sparked international interest in the Civil War, &amp; taught generations of readers/viewers about how to navigate through the ups &amp; downs of life &amp; relationships along the way.

       "   'Cantinflas llegó a Estados Unidos de la mano de Columbia Pictures, que en los años 40 comenzó a distribuir sus películas a nivel internacional. De hecho, se decía que si llevabas a este personaje en el reparto, era más fácil que la cinta tuviera éxito.<br><br>Sin embargo, Mario Moreno cosechó su mayor éxito tras filmar “La vuelta al mundo en 80 días”, actuación por la que se le premió con el Globo de Oro. Una terna en la que se encontraba al lado del mismísimo Marlon Brando. En ese mismo año Cantinflas se convirtió en el actor mejor pagado del mundo.<br><br>Time destacó la actuación del famoso cómico mexicano Cantinflas, quien en su primera película estadounidense da una deliciosa evidencia de que bien podría ser, como dijo una vez Charles Chaplin que era, el payaso más grande del mundo.<br><br>Charles Chaplin lo nombró El Mejor Comediante del Mundo. Cantinflas es irrepetible. Como actor cómico, me quito el sombrero con este maravilloso mimo mexicano que, con dulzura e ingenuidad, sabe llevar al respetable a situaciones tranquilas y de goce pleno. Me hizo reír mucho y considero que todavía no se le ha dado el sitio que merece. Dicen que el actor británico admiraba mucho a Cantinflas y que incluso se habría puesto en contacto con él para hacer una película juntos, pero el proyecto no pudo llevarse a cabo. ¿Te imaginas a estos dos actores juntos en una cinta?',\n",
       "   'En 1966, la esposa de Cantinflas luchaba contra el cáncer. El presidente Lyndon B. Johnson, amigo personal del actor cómico, envió un avión del gobierno de Estados Unidos a la Ciudad de México para llevar a Valentina a un hospital de Houston para recibir tratamiento.<br><br>Además, había sido acogido como huésped en la Casa Blanca por John Fitzgerald Kennedy, y su sucesor Lyndon B. Johnson le otorgó el honor de ser el primer mexicano invitado a dormir en la residencia presidencial de Estados Unidos. Cuando me preguntaron qué sentí, respondí que la CIA me espiaba. Y si se enteran de mis sueños, ¡me encierran!, contó.<br><br>Con nosotros en ese día memorable aquí en este mismo lugar en noviembre de 1961, estaba un muy viejo y muy querido amigo mío y un buen amigo suyo Cantinflas.  Pasó el fin de semana conmigo y en mi casa anoche, y vino aquí hoy para unirse a nosotros nuevamente en esta reunión. Todo el mundo conoce a Cantinflas como uno de los comediantes más grandes y queridos de todos los tiempos. Pero lo conocemos mejor como un hombre cuyo corazón siempre está con su prójimo. Lo conocemos como un hombre que cree en la dignidad humana. Lo conocemos como un hombre que ha hecho más para promover las buenas relaciones entre Estados Unidos y nuestro vecino del sur, México, que la mayoría de los estadistas profesionales.<br><br>Cuando nuestros amigos vienen aquí, vienen simbólicamente a todos los hogares estadounidenses. Y nadie podría ser más bienvenido en el hogar estadounidense esta noche que nuestro vecino, México.<br><br>Debo advertirle, señor presidente, que hay entre nosotros un compatriota suyo, cuya popularidad es tal, que si se postulara para un cargo público en cualquiera de los dos países, podría retirarnos a los dos a la vida privada. Es nuestra buena suerte que Cantinflas prefiera burlarse de los presidentes en lugar de competir contra ellos. Cuando aparece en la escena política, como puede testificar Henry González, el efecto es simplemente abrumador.<br><br>Con el debido respeto al señor Cantinflas y sus compañeros actores, señor presidente, creo que usted y yo sabemos que hay al menos una diferencia significativa entre ser presidente en las películas y tener el trabajo. Como uno de nuestros propios comediantes estadounidenses, el difunto Will Rogers, solía decir con frecuencia &quot;Hacer girar una cuerda es siempre mucho más divertido cuando el cuello no está en ella&quot;.',\n",

       "   'Bette Davis&#39;s electrifying on the scene. Curiously, Of Human Bondage was unsuccessful in 1934. The criticisms were mixed about the film. The public didn&#39;t tolerate the way the waitress Mildred (Bette Davis) had infuriated the young medical student Philip (Leslie Howard). In between the lines the moralistic discourse is evident: educated males should not be involved emotionally with vulgar females and without cradle. Several RKO Radio Pictures stars declined to play Midred. However, Bette Davis&#39;s performance was highly praised and she was elevated to star status, not beauty, for the appearance of the waitress was sloppy, but for the talent. The absence of Bette in the nominations for the Oscar of better actress generated protests. The compensation came the following year, when she received the award for a performance that neither she liked in Dangerous. When Of Human Bondage went into production Bette was hired by Warner and was not satisfied with the production system, which didn&#39;t always give priority to quality. The actors participated in one production after another, and sometimes up to two at the same time. This was because the studios had to feed the movie circuits, all week, with new tapes. As everyone knows, there was no television and the most accessible entertainment was the movies. Bette starred in 22 films before Of Human Bondage. She had good roles in The Cabin in the Cotton, 20,000 Years in Sing Sing and The Working Man, but was not so lucky in other jobs. To be part of the cast of Of Human Bondage, Bette still had to participate in Fog Over Frisco, in which her character is murdered and disappears before the story ends. In 1934, the actress had already acted for Warner in Fashions of 1934 and Jimmy the Gent. Soon after Of Human Bondage, did, also, in the same year, Housewife.',\n",

Somerset Maugham and tells the story of a failed artist who decides to study medicine. He becomes completely infatuated with a young waitress who is intent on breaking his heart over and over. It is only finally when she dies that he can break free from the bond that ties him to her. Belle & Sebastians 'Waking up to us' is a perfect song to describe a doomed love which seems impossible to accept and therefore I think it fits perfectly with this film!

I remember that we had it on V.H.S but it was used a lot and older so although it worked fine right when they found Paw(or Paul actually) it would stop and I would never see the ending. Then my Mom bought me the special edition version on D.V.D so I could watch it on my D.V.D players and see the ending. I loved all the songs but “Candle On The Water” is definitely my favorite. Not to mention I love the character Eliot and when you think how hard it was for them to make this movie then and learn the process for it is is incredible.

De drie kinderen ontdekken al snel het geheim van Price. Om ze stil te houden betovert ze een bed zodat de kinderen hiermee naar elke plaats ter wereld kunnen reizen. Omdat de aanbieder van de cursus, professor Emelius Browne, plotseling is opgehouden haar nieuwe lessen toe te sturen, zoeken Price en de kinderen hem op in Londen. Al snel blijkt Browne een oplichter te zijn die spreuken uit een oud toverboek kopieert en verkoopt als “cursus”. Hij is dan ook stomverbaasd dat de spreuken bij Price echt blijken te werken. Hij heeft echter niet de spreuk waar Price naar zoekt.<br>In een poging deze spreuk te vinden reizen Price, Browne en de kinderen de wereld over. De spreuk blijkt uiteindelijk op een medaillon te staan dat verstopt is op het eiland Naboombu; een eiland bewoond door getekende antropomorfe dieren. Met veel moeite slagen ze erin de spreuk te bemachtigen.<br>Eenmaal thuis is de groep getuige van hoe een aantal Duitse soldaten aan land komen als voorhoede voor een invasie. Price gebruikt de nieuwe spreuk om een groot aantal harnassen en oude wapens in een museum tot leven te brengen en de Duitsers te verslaan. De Duitsers blazen echter wel Prices huis op, waar al haar spreuken opgeslagen lagen. Price besluit hierop om haar cursus tot heks te laten voor wat het is.',\n",
